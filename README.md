# Integration of LangChain with Magnolia
This repository proposes an integration of [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai) with [Magnolia](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/) by implementing a document loader that allows the introduction of contents from [Magnolia](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/) in the pipeline of [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai)

## Python implementation
It is provided the python notebook `chat_with_magnolia.ipynb` that implements the document loader and shows an example of usage.

## Javascript implementation
The document loader made in javascript is published in the following [fork](https://github.com/joaquin-alfaro/langchainjs/tree/feature/magnolia-loader) of [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs)

https://github.com/joaquin-alfaro/langchainjs/tree/feature/magnolia-loader

The typescript code `chat_with_magnolia.ts` provides an example of usage of the document loader.
